## Description

- My aim is to make sure that the code runs properly and accurate, and 
I will use Exceptions to catch invalid transaction, and display them 
to the users. 
- I will also run through the program using a debuging tool, to make 
sure that there isn't any logic errors, and to modify the program if 
needed, to ensure that the code runs properly as expected.
